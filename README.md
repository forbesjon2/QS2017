# QS2017
Quantopian project that I worked on in the summer of 2017. I successfully ran it for a few weeks but in september of 2017 Q ended live trading support. This was my first project so the code is a mess & it's not meant for live trading


## How to run your own backtests using this algorithm in quantopian.
1. make a quantopian account
2. Make an algorithm
3. copy and paste the code in QS2017.py into the quantopian algorithm
4. click run full backtest

## Example backtest
